and what i have learned till date i have stared project building 
on day 1 i have an dataset of my college and my branch in that dataset marks , cgpa , pass/fail , earn creadits and etc coloumns are there so with the help of superviesd learning i have created an prediction model helps to new student which he can enter his marks , earn credits and cgpa and on this basis model will be able to detect he is pass or fail 

steps 
1. import data 
2. preprocess
3. perform EDA to get known about the data using pandas profile
4. train test spilt
5. using pipeline doing whatever the data wants
6. and then using test data model testing
7. and last is the accuracy score
